        <p class="lore">I want to become healtheir so that I am able to accomplish more. By eating better and working out ill be able to live a much better life and do what I want to do compared to not trying to become healthier where you are slower, more tiresome, and in general just a shadow of what you could be. During the first few months of the year I'll follow a simple training regimen and continue until the end of the year and see how I progressed through the year.</p>

        <p class="lore">Maintaining good grades while hard to do, can help me become successful in life and get me into a good college. Not only will this allow me to be better educated, but also encourage me to dedicate time towards my education and show that I care about my grades compared to not caring. For the first quater of the year I'll make sure to be studying for each test and quiz, however focus slightly more on the SAT then actual school studying. For the second quater I'll make sure to focus mostly on the SAT as that is when it takes place, however also focusing some attention on school work. The laster two quarters is mainly focusing on just school work by studying and practicing.</p>

        <p class="lore">I've learned that I enjoy to rock climb, however it is not a easy thing to do at all. While it might be easy on lower levels, as you rise in the difficulties of climbing walls you realize that you need to gain the mental and physical strength in order to send those walls. It is an extremely ambitious goal, but one I think I can accomplish. For the first and second quater of the year I'll make sure to just climb every now and then and focus on just having fun rather then accomlishing hard routes. The last two quaters will be working out and training physically and mentally to make sure I can start to get past harder walls.</p>
